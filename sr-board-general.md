# SR Board General Maintenance

## Equipment

 * Warm soapy water
 * Blue/white cloth
 * Small flat bladed screw driver
 * Permanent marker
 * Label printer
 * Laptop (to print replacement labels and to munge inventory)

## Procedure

 1. Visually inspect the board inside the case for any obvious damage/blown components. If there is any damage, mark the board as broken in the inventory and move onto the next board.
 1. Check the case of the board for any cracks or missing parts and replace as necessary.
 1. Remove any tape or velcro attached to the case.
 1. Clean the outside of the case using a small amount of warm soapy water.
 1. Check that the SR part code (both human readable and QR) is undamaged and replace as necessary. If it is only the human readable code that is damaged you may  be able to touch this up with a pen.
