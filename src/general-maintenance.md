# General Maintenance[^1]

## Equipment

 * Warm soapy water
 * Blue/white cloth
 * Permanent marker
 * Label printer
 * Laptop (to print replacement labels and to munge inventory)

## Procedure

 1. Visually inspect the part for any obvious damage/blown components. If there is any damage, mark the part as broken in the inventory and move onto the next board. If the only damage is to the acrylic case of an SR board then come back to it and continue this procedure once you have performed General Maintenance on all of the other boards.
 1. Remove any tape or velcro attached to the case.
 1. Clean the outside of the case using a small amount of warm soapy water.
 1. Check that the SR part code (both human readable and QR) is undamaged and replace as necessary. If it is only the human readable code that is damaged you may  be able to touch this up with a pen.
